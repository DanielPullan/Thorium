# Thorium
(I wanted a name related to Norse Mythology whilst keeping with the naming conventions at work.)

## Requirements
Currently, you need a bunch of linux based clients, I'm using OG Raspberry Pi's.
You'll need a browser, a webserver and rsync installed on all the clients.
You'll then need a host linux server, again i'm using a pi. This will need a webserver, rsync then whatever i need for the admin stuff.
Then you'll need to be able to login with SSH keys from the master server to all the clients.

I will add more instructions to use once I've finished this thing.


A replacement for PHS's current Digital Signage Solution
