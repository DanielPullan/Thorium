# Thorium
Thorium is a bespoke Digital Signage Solution, made for Poole High School in Dorset, England.
Although originally made for Poole High School, Thorium is open source and free to anyone to use, edit and/or share.

As well as Digital Signage, Thorium also has two Python Scripts for installing and managing instances of the software running.

Thorium has turned into a weird mess of software that works pretty well on limited hardware (we're using Raspberry Pi Model B's with 4 gig SD Cards).

Check out the Wiki for instructions and help, if you're really stuck, open an issue and either I or some other kind soul will try to help you.
